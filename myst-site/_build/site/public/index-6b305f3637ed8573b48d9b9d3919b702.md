# Machine Learning Guide

Welcome to the Machine Learning Guide! This resource is designed to help you understand machine learning concepts, from basic models to advanced neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This guide follows an Occam's razor approach, starting with simpler models and gradually progressing to more complex ones.
